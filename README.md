## Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as community members, contributors, moderators, and project leaders pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

**Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:**

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing perspectives and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Helping beginners instead of mocking them
- Being patient, accepting and descriptive while asking questions

**Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:**

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Spamming public channel, tagging someone multiple time to irritate them
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities
Community leaders and Moderators are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project committers, Moderators and leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, images, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any member for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all public channels and community events, and it also applies when an individual is representing the Hack Club SSGI in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include posting via an official social media account, or acting as a project representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the Community Leaders at **hackclub.ssgi@gmail.com**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

Moderators or leaders who do not follow the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Attribution
This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant , version 1.4, available [here](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html).

Enforcement Guidelines were inspired by _GitHub Campus Experts Code of Conduct_.
